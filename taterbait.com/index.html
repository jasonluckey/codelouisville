    <p id="small-headline">I have a pair of AirPods</p>
     <p id="large-headline">My AirPods are great</p>
     <p> I <strong>love</strong> them</p>
     <p> I purchased them as soon as they were available on the Apple website. Sure, I paid a lot of money for them, and maybe I should have spent it on medicine or food, but daggone it, I needed to have some weird things flopping off my ear holes.</p>
     <p>Some people complain that they won't stay in their ears. I haven't had that issue. But I would also counter that those folks that have found that the AirPods fall out of their ears should explore velcro. Just put a piece on the AirPod and then the attaching piece on the inside of their ear canal. </p>
     <p><strong>PROBLEM SOLVED</strong></p>
