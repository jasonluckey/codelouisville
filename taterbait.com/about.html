    <p>Inspired by Calliou, I began wearing striped shirts at an early age. It wasn't until I was 14 before I realized that solid shirts would also be acceptable attire. At 15 I started wearing pants. It made a world of difference</p>
    <p> I have been alive for at least as long as I can remember, though I'm told I was alive before that. You know, that brings up a memory of how my best friend in grade school swore he was a reincarnation of an important monarch from China.</p>
    <p> There have been times where <strong>I</strong> have thought I was reincarnated. But then, as I graze in the meadow and slowly chew the daisies and grass, I wonder what my past life could have been.</p>
    <p>In any event, I've now grown into my shoes and realize that socks can be used for more than just holding cereal.</p>
